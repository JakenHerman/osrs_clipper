# OSRS Clipper

Our goal is to build an OSRS RuneScape clipping tool that does the following:

 - [ ] Detect Key Moments: Analyze an OSRS video stream to identify events like loot drops, PvP kills, or level-ups using computer vision or AI.

 - [ ] Generate Highlight Clips: When a key event is detected, automatically generate a video clip from the stream using tools like FFmpeg.

 - [ ] Store Clips on S3: Upload the generated clip to an Amazon S3 bucket for persistent storage.

 - [ ] Provide a Web API: Create an API using Actix Web to retrieve a list of clips and provide access to each clipâ€™s URL.

 - [ ] Distributed Processing on EKS: Package the application as Docker containers and run them on AWS EKS for scalability.
